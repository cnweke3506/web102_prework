## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Understanding how to correctly use reduce(), filter(), and template literals in the different challenges.

Getting the unfunded and funded filter buttons to work properly took debugging because the functions were nested incorrectly at first.

Learning how to update the DOM dynamically and making sure to use deleteChildElements() before repopulating the page.

Ensuring the images displayed correctly inside the template literals — I had to pay attention to spaces after the src tag.

Setting up the README and GIF walkthrough was new to me, especially inserting the GIF file into the repository.

Debugging sorting and destructuring for the top funded games section.

Despite these challenges, I learned a lot and now feel more confident with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and GitHub workflows.
